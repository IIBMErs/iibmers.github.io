## Automatization of lab equipment with iot technology

We are adapting an implemented home assistant (HASSIO) software in a Raspberry Pi and adding custom sensors and lab equipment enchanced with esp32 boards that allow a full remote control, also we will implement different views, databases and user interfaces to record experiments and manage equipment usage turns.
