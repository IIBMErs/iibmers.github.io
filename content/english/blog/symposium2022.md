We are glad to invite you to our first *Advances in Biological and Medical Engineering*'s annual symposium. Organized by the community of the Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering (IIBM), this event aims to showcase international interdisciplinary research and development ongoing at the IIBM for the scientific community at all levels: students, professors, and all people interested in this field.

We are proud to have national guests of great professional and human quality who will share their experience and innovative ideas in the fields of Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology. Furthermore, we seek to nurture interesting interdisciplinary discussions during the event, for which we will have several interactive sessions such as short presentations and poster sessions.

As organizers of the symposium and IIBM, we are pleased to make this event a valuable opportunity to learn, teach, and share about interdisciplinary science!

We hope you will join us and participate in this event that we have prepared with great dedication.

Greetings to all,

Organizers of the Symposium on Advances in Biological and Medical Engineering.

__Title__: "Evaluating cellular force using machine learning for mechanobiology and drug screening"


__Abstract:__
Recent progress in understanding the essential roles of mechanical forces in regulating various cellular functions expands the field of cell biology to one where interdisciplinary approaches, in addition to conventional molecular biology approaches, become indispensable. Cellular traction forces (CTF) – generated in proliferative cells including cancer cells – are one of such mechanical forces that regulate the function of the cells, and thus the evaluation of the forces using engineering techniques is becoming a key for better understanding of the complicated phenomena of the cells. CTF is created with the activity of ubiquitous proteins known as non-muscle actin and myosin II, but because these proteins work downstream of diverse signaling pathways, it is often difficult to predict how the CTF changes upon perturbations to particular molecules such as gene mutations and drugs. Here I will talk about our new technology with a high-throughput data analysis capability to determine whether the CTF is up-regulated or down-regulated upon perturbations. For this experiment, we plate cells on deformable substrates, in which “wrinkles” are generated on the surface upon the exertion of CTF. These wrinkles are detected and finally converted to the actual mechanical force by using a machine learning technique. This technology allows us to comprehensively evaluate the change in cell function/disease-associated CTF caused by mutations, knockdown, or over-expression of particular genes and how those changes are enhanced or rescued by means of drugs.
