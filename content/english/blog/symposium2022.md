We are glad to invite you to our first *Advances in Biological and Medical Engineering*'s annual symposium. Organized by the community of the Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering (IIBM), this event aims to showcase international interdisciplinary research and development ongoing at the IIBM for the scientific community at all levels: students, professors, and all people interested in this field.

We are proud to have national guests of great professional and human quality who will share their experience and innovative ideas in the fields of Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology. Furthermore, we seek to nurture interesting interdisciplinary discussions during the event, for which we will have several interactive sessions such as short presentations and poster sessions.

As organizers of the symposium and IIBM, we are pleased to make this event a valuable opportunity to learn, teach, and share about interdisciplinary science!

We hope you will join us and participate in this event that we have prepared with great dedication.

Greetings to all,

Organizers of the Symposium on Advances in Biological and Medical Engineering.
